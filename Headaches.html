        <p class="s-18 text-center">What do you do when you suffer from a pounding headache? Do you grind your teeth and
            carry on? Lie down? Pop a pill and hope the pain goes away?</p>

        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">1. What is a headache?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Headaches are a common health problem. Nine out of ten people suffer from headaches. Some are
            occasional, some frequent, some are dull and throbbing, and some cause debilitating pain and nausea.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">2. What trigger a headache?</h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/Headaches/headaches-2-768x512.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="s-18">In order to understand headaches, you first need to find out what is causing your pain.
            Headaches can have many causes or “triggers.” These may include foods, environmental stimuli (noises,
            lights, stress, etc.) and/or behaviors (insomnia, excessive exercise, blood sugar changes, etc.).</p>
        <p class="s-18">About 5 percent of all headaches are warning signals caused by a serious physical problems.
            Whereas the other 95 percent of headaches are primary headaches, such as tension, migraine, or cluster
            headaches. These types of headaches are not caused by another disease. The headache itself is the primary
            concern.</p>
        <p class="s-18">The greatest majority of primary headaches are associated with muscle tension in the neck.
            People today bend over computers, engage in more sedentary activities than they used to, and more hours are
            spent in one fixed position or posture. This can increase joint irritation and muscle tension in the neck,
            upper back and scalp, causing your head to ache.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">3. What can you do?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">We suggests the following:</p>
        <p class="s-18">If you spend a large amount of time in one fixed position, such as in front of a computer, on a
            sewing machine, typing or reading, take a break and stretch every 30 minutes to one hour. The stretches
            should take your head and neck through a comfortable range of motion.</p>
        <p class="s-18">Low-impact exercise may help to relieve the pain associated with primary headaches. However, if
            you are prone to dull throbbing headaches, then avoid heavy exercise and engage in such activities as
            walking and low-impact aerobics.</p>
        <p class="s-18">To avoid teeth clenching, the upper teeth should never touch the lowers except when swallowing.
            This results in stress at the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) – the two joints that connect your jaw to your
            skull – leading to TMJ irritation and a form of tension headaches.</p>
        <p class="s-18">Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day to help avoid dehydration, which can lead to
            headaches.</p>
        <p class="s-18">There is also evidence that you should also avoid the following food “triggers”:
        <ul>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h3>Caffeine:</h3> Foods such as chocolate, coffee, sodas and cocoa contain high levels of the
                stimulant.
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h3>Sugar and Salt:</h3> Avoid foods with a high salt or sugar content. These foods may cause migraines,
                resulting in sensitivity to light, noise, or abrupt movements.
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h3>Alcohol:</h3> Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages. These drinks can dehydrate you and cause headache
                pain.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="s-18">In certain cases, headache sufferers may want to avoid not only caffeine, but also high-protein
            foods, dairy products and red meat.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">4. How can Chiropractic care help those with headaches?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">
