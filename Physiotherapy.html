        <p class="s-18">Physiotherapy helps people affected by injury, illness and disability regain movement and function. It can also help you reduce your risk of re-injury or illness in the future. Physiotherapy is now considered a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy that can help patients recover quickly and return to daily life.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">1. What is physiotherapy?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Physiotherapy is a treatment that involves the application of physical variables to the patient’s body, such as mechanical movement and exercise, manual therapy, therapeutic therapy (ultrasound, light, heat), education, and advice to assist the body in regaining its lost functions. Physiotherapy also supports pain alleviation. This strategy has helped people of all ages improve their health while actively increasing strength, endurance, mobility, and coordination.</p>

        </div>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">2. Types of physiotherapy</h1>
        <p class="s-18">There are many forms and techniques of physiotherapy, but they fall into two main categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>2.1. Passive physiotherapy</h2>
                <p>This method is used when a patient is too weak for specific activities or when they have too much pain or discomfort. With passive physiotherapy, patients do not have to actively engage and use their muscles and joints. Instead, heat therapy, light therapy or hydrotherapy, electrical stimulation, ultrasound therapy, manual massage, etc., are used to reduce stress, release compressed nerves and accelerate the regeneration of damaged tissues.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>2.2. Active physiotherapy</h2>
                <p>Active physiotherapy, on the other hand, is a step up from passive methods. Patients will begin to use their bodies and muscles to engage in the treatment. This method includes exercises that are designed to combine with appropriate equipment and instructions from a physiotherapist.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">3. How does physiotherapy work?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Depending on your specific problems, many different methods may be involved in your treatment.</p>
        <p class="s-18">Three main approaches a physiotherapist makes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>3.1. Education and advice</h2>
                <p>One of the main aspects that contribute to a successful treatment plan involves looking at the body as a whole, rather than focusing on the individual factors of an injury. Therefore, giving general advice about ways to improve your wellbeing. Your therapist or primary health care provider can give you specific recommendations to apply to your daily activities to take care of yourself and reduce your risk of pain or injury.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>3.2. Exercise and movement</h2>
                <p>A treatment program that is designed to help you restore your functionality and mobility. Through specific exercises and state-of-the-art equipment. This approach’s goals include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep your muscles flexible and strong.</li>
                    <li>Reduce pain and swelling in the affected joints.</li>
                    <li>Improve balance and coordination.</li>
                    <li>Prevent deformities and future complications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>3.3. Manual therapy</h2>
                <p><a href="#">Manual therapy</a> can be used to treat specific problems, such as <a href="#">back pain</a>, but can also be beneficial for a range of conditions that don’t affect the bones, joints, or muscles. It has also been shown that the method provides positive psychological effects related to anxiety, stress, or sleeping disorders. <a href="#">Laser therapy</a> or <a href="#">Shockwave therapy</a> can also be combined to maximize the effectiveness of manual therapy.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above approaches, other effective physiotherapy treatments that are often recommended include:</p>
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>3.4. Heat & ice therapy</h2>
                <p>Heat can be very beneficial for chronic pain and stiffness. By placing a moist heat pack on the skin, it can help improve circulation and blood flow. Ice, on the other hand, is recommended for acute injuries. It works by reducing blood flow to reduce inflammation and swelling, especially around a joint or a tendon. It can temporarily reduce nerve activity, which can also relieve pain.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>3.5. Therapeutic ultrasound</h2>
                <p>This method can be utilized for injuries related to most soft tissues, joints, and muscle spasms. When applied to problem areas in soft tissues and joints, it produces heat that helps reduce inflammation and increase blood flow, in addition to decreasing pain, stiffness, and spasms. It can facilitate the body’s healing process at the most basic cellular level.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="s-18">
                <h2>3.6. Electrical modalities</h2>
                <p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a method of pain relief involving the use of a mild electrical current. TENS can be beneficial for muscle spasms and alleviate pain.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">4. When is physiotherapy used?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Physiotherapy is helpful for people of all ages and with varying health conditions. In particular, conditions requiring physiotherapy include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="s-18"><h3>Neuromuscular diseases:</h3> traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, etc.</li>
            <li class="s-18"><h3>Musculoskeletal-joint disorders:</h3> fractures, spondylolisthesis, <a href="#">scoliosis</a>, ligament or soft tissues damage and inflammation, etc.</li>
            <li class="s-18"><h3>Respiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases:</h3> pneumonia, bronchial asthma, pulmonary obstruction, etc.</li>
            <li class="s-18"><h3>Congenital disorders:</h3> brain retardation, meningitis, congenital disabilities, etc.</li>
            <li class="s-18"><h3>After surgery:</h3> certain body parts might lose their function and work incorrectly after a surgery. Physiotherapy exercises can assist with the recovery process and restore the function of the body parts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">5. Why physiotherapy?</h1>

        <p class="s-18">A patient who receives physiotherapy treatment will work with a therapist.
