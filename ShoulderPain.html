        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">1. Common Shoulder Problems
        </h1>
        <p class="s-18">Shoulder pain is any discomfort in the shoulder. It is debilitating, miserable, and can badly
            interfere with your daily activities.</p>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.1. Frozen Shoulder
        </h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/ShoulderPain/shoulder-pain-9.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="s-18">Frozen shoulder is extremely painful and characterized by a restriction in the motion of the
            joint. It also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your
            shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and often persists for many
            years. It can be a result of injury or begin for no apparent reason.</p>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.2. Shoulder Bursitis
        </h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/ShoulderPain/shoulder-pain-8.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="s-18">Inside each of your shoulders is a tiny, fluid-filled sac known as a bursa. Bursae help reduce
            friction between the bones in your joints. Shoulder bursitis is a condition that affects the bursae. Causes
            can include injury, overuse, or medical conditions that cause joint inflammation, such as rheumatoid
            arthritis.
        </p>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.3. Impingement Syndrome
        </h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/ShoulderPain/shoulder-pain-6.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="s-18">Impingement syndrome is the result of excessive squeezing or rubbing of the rotator cuff and
            shoulder blade. The rubbing leads to more swelling and further narrowing of the space, which results in pain
            and irritation. Shoulder impingement syndrome can lead to a torn rotator cuff.</p>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.4. Rotator Cuff
        </h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/ShoulderPain/shoulder-pain-7.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="s-18">The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, keeping the
            head of your upper arm bone firmly within the shallow socket of the shoulder. Rotator cuff injuries are
            common and increase with age. Without treatment, rotator cuff problems may lead to permanent loss of motion
            or weakness, and may result in progressive degeneration of the shoulder joint or might even require surgery.
        </p>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.5. Shoulder Dislocation
        </h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/ShoulderPain/acc-shouder-dislo.jpeg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="s-18">A dislocated shoulder is an injury in which your upper arm bone pops out of the cup-shaped
            socket that’s part of your shoulder blade. The shoulder is the body’s most mobile joint, which makes it
            susceptible to dislocation.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">2. How Can Chiropractic Care Help with Shoulder Pain?
        </h1>
        <p class="s-18">Chiropractic care can be a great way to manage and relieve shoulder pain. To see if chiropractic
            care is right for your condition, our doctors at ZaraTherapyClinic will perform a consultation, examination,
