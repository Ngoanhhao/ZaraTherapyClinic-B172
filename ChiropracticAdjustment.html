        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">1. What is Chiropractic?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Chiropractic is a way of looking at the human body as a whole. It is based on the idea that given the right environment, the body is self­-sustaining and self­-healing.</p>
        <p class="s-18">know that your body is controlled by your brain, but the spinal cord and the nervous system are just as important. When this system is not functioning at its peak, your body’s overall performance suffers.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">2. What is Chiropractic Adjustment?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Chiropractic adjustments are essential for spinal joints that aren’t moving correctly, which can cause irritability in the nearby nerves. Chiropractic adjustments add motion to these stuck joints, reducing nervous system disruption.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">3. Is Chiropractic Care Safe?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Many people think a chiropractor only treats back pain and neck pain; however, they are trained in treating a large variety of conditions, including headaches, sciatica, arthritis, disc injury, and much more.</p>
        <p class="s-18">Chiropractic care is generally considered one of the safest drug-free, non-invasive treatments available. Many patients feel immediate relief from chiropractic treatment, but some may experience soreness, stiffness, or aching.</p>
        <p class="s-18">Sharing your symptoms and concern with your chiropractor helps him deliver a suitable treatment for your specific condition.</p>

        </div>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">4. What is the Goal of Chiropractic Care?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">The goal of chiropractic care is to correct the body’s structural alignment to improve how it functions overall. When your body is out of alignment, this condition can cause tissue damage and contribute to various health issues. Chiropractic treatment can increase range of motion in the spine and joints of the body, an essential factor in how you feel.</p>
