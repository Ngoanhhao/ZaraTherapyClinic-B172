        <p class="s-18">Wrist pain is any discomfort in the wrist. Wrist pain may vary, depending on the cause.

        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">1. Common Wrist Problems
        </h1>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.1. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
        </h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/wrist/wrist-pain-3.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="s-18">TCarpal tunnel syndrome is an increasingly prevalent problem in the modern world. Carpal tunnel
            syndrome occurs when the median nerve becomes compressed or pinched. It is located on the palm side of your
            hand, providing sensation to the following parts of the hand:</p>
        <ul class="s-18">
            <li>Thumb.</li>
            <li>Index finger.
            </li>
            <li>Middle finger.
            </li>
            <li>Part of the ring finger.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="s-18">It also provides the electrical impulse to the muscle leading to the thumb. Carpal tunnel
            syndrome can occur in one or both of your hands. Swelling in the wrist causes compression in carpal tunnel
            syndrome. The pain is due to excess pressure in your wrist and on the median nerve.</p>
        <p class="s-18">Aside from causing wrist pain, carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to numbness, weakness, and
            tingling on the side of your hand near the thumb.</p>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.2. Wrist Injury
        </h1>
        <div class="img1 w-100 text-center">
            <img width="50%" src="assets/Img/wrist/wrist-pain-7-768x384.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="s-18">An injury to your wrist can also cause pain. Wrist injuries include sprains, broken bones, and
            tendonitis. Swelling, bruising, or disfigured joints near the wrist may be symptoms of a wrist injury. Some
            wrist injuries can happen right away due to the trauma of an impact. Others may develop slowly over time.
        </p>
        <h1 class="s-24">1.3. Gout</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid. Most uric acid is dissolved in the blood and removed
            from the body through urination. However, in some cases, the body produces too much uric acid. The excess
            uric acid can be deposited in the joints, resulting in pain and swelling. This pain frequently occurs in the
            knees, ankles, wrists, and feet.</p>
        <h1 class="s-24"> 1.4. Arthritis</h1>
        <p class="s-18">Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints. The condition can cause swelling and stiffness in
            the affected body part. Arthritis has many causes, including normal wear and tear, aging, and overworking
            the hands.</p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">2. How Can ZaraTherapyClinic Help Those with Wrist Pain?

        </h1>
