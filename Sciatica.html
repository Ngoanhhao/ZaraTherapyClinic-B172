        <p class="s-18 text-center">Simply put, sciatica is nerve pain from irritation of the sciatic nerve,
            located in the lower back that runs down the back of each leg.</p>

        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">1. What is Sciatica?</h1>
        <p class="s-18">There are many ways to describe sciatica pain. The sensations can range from dull, achy, sharp,
            burning, numbing, and tingling. Sciatica is also called radiating or referred pain, neuropathy, or
            neuralgia. Sciatica is not a disorder. It is a symptom of a disorder, several of which cause this kind of
            pain.</p>
        <p class="s-18">Sciatica occurs when the sciatic nerve becomes pinched, usually by lumbar subluxations
            (misalignment of the bones in the lower spine) or by herniated and bulging discs. Pregnancy and childbirth
            can increase the potential of getting sciatic pain. More rarely, the nerve can be compressed by a tumor,
            prolonged sitting or damaged by a disease such as diabetes..</p>
        <p class="s-18">One common cause of sciatica is Piriformis Syndrome. Piriformis Syndrome is named after the
            piriformis muscle. The piriformis muscle is located in the lower part of the spine, connects to the thigh
            bone, and assists in hip rotation. The sciatic nerve runs beneath the piriformis muscle. This muscle is
            susceptible to injury from a slip and fall, hip arthritis, or a difference in leg length. Such situations
            can cause cramping and spasm to develop in the piriformis muscle, and therefore compress the sciatic nerve.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-start text-primary">2. How Can Chiropractic Care Help Those with Sciatica?
        </h1>
        <p class="s-18">Chiropractic care can be a great way to manage and relieve sciatica pain. Chiropractic care
            provides patients a safe, non-invasive alternative to take a step closer to their health goals. Our doctors
            at ZaraTherapyClinic will perform a consultation, examination, and if necessary, refer you out for
            diagnostic imaging such as X-ray or MRI. Based on the findings of our chiropractic exam and consultation,
            your doctor of chiropractic will elect a suitable type of treatment for your specific conditions.</p>
